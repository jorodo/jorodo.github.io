==============
John R. Dowdle
==============

In my work life I am a computational chemical engineer at The Dow Chemical
Company where I develop simulation capabilities for gas-liquid separation
processes.  In my home life, my wife and I are busy raising our two young
children.  In rare moments of spare time some of the things I enjoy include the
outdoors, backpacking, music, Linux, and reading.

My Contact Information

Work & Research
---------------

My expertise is in the areas of molecular thermodynamics and scientific &
engineering software development, although more recently I have also been
involved in kinetics & reaction engineering research.  My current projects at
Dow Chemical are focused on developing rate-based models for gas-liquid
separations.

Prior to joining Dow, I completed my Ph.D. at The University of Texas at Austin
in the general area of statistical thermodynamics of liquids. Eventually I will
attempt to write a high-level summary of my graduate work here, but in the
meantime, here is a copy of my dissertation_.

I am interested in applying my skills in simulation and software development to
a broad range of industrial topics including acid gas treating, carbon capture
& storage, petroleum reservoir thermodynamics, and natural gas storage &
production.

Code
----

Most of my work these days is proprietary.  However, I'm in the process of
moving some of my open projects (mostly from graduate school days) to github:
`jrd's code repositories`_.  My biggest coding project in graduate school was
writing JLS_, a Monte Carlo engine implementing several enhanced sampling
techniques for core-softened model liquids.

My most familiar languages are Python, C++, and C.  I'm fairly well acquainted
with Fortran as well, and I'm experienced with application development on Linux
and MS Windows.

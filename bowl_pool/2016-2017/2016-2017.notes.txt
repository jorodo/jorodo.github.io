Errors in Scoring
-----------------

* CORRECTED: Error in the formula for scoring the second bowl game (Western
  Kentucky vs. Memphis).  No one got any points for that game as a result.

* CORRECTED: #MamaBear's score is inflated by 1.25 points due to prematurely
   counting the Georgia Tech vs. Kentucky game (not yet played) in her favor.
   This error only appeared in #MamaBear's score.

Errors on Picks
---------------

Program Output:

    error: bowl 3, team Godiva, pick V does not match fav or dog.
        guessing favorite.
    error: bowl 9, team Cowboy, pick M  does not match fav or dog.
        guessing dog.
    error: bowl 12, team After Further Review, pick S does not match fav or dog.
        guessing favorite.
    error: bowl 20, team EM43, pick S does not match fav or dog.
        guessing dog.
    error: bowl 20, team Thetis, pick S does not match fav or dog.
        guessing dog.
    error: bowl 29, team Eclipse, pick x does not match fav or dog.
        guessing favorite.

Note that this code requires every pick to be a fav or a dog.  Hence I have to
make some assumptions on these errors ... either I guess what they really
picked, or I just don't give them credit at all (by making their pick the loser
of the game).  Currently I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt by assuming
the following things:

* ASSUMED Godiva picked B for BYU

* ASSUMED Cowboy picked A for Army

* ASSUMED After Further Review picked A for Army

* ASSUMED EM43 picked SF for South Florida

* ASSUMED Thetis picked SF for South Florida

* ASSUMED Eclipse picked G for Georgia Tech


Errors on Sure Thing Bowls
--------------------------

* CORRECTED: Bumblerooski picked Army in the Heart of Dallas Bowl as a sure
  thing, but the spreadsheet does not have this marked as sure thing and
  instead has him picking Temple for a sure thing bowl.

* NOTE: In the Cactus Bowl (Baylor vs. Boise State), the spreadsheet has "B"
  for Baylor and "BS" for Boise State, but the convention is to append "S" to
  the pick if it is a sure thing pick.  This is in conflict with the assignment
  here, because picking Baylor as a sure thing results in "BS", which denotes
  picking Boise State (picking Boise State as a sure thing gives "BSS").  Of
  course, this doesn't matter if no one out there picked Baylor as a sure thing.

The following teams do not have 3 sure thing bowl picks:

* NOTE: 39 OSUX3 Fan has 5 sure thing bowl picks
* NOTE: 52 Troll Factory Inc has 4 sure thing bowl picks

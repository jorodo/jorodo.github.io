Notes:
------

 * Team Aaron has picked four sure thing bowls.

 * Hunter 55's pick for the Alabama/Mich St. game is "AL" instead of "A", and
   as a result he received no points in Rob's spreadsheet.  I'm assuming he
   meant Alabama.

 * The following teams do not have 3 sure thing bowls:
   - 34 Hunter 55 (2)
   - 37 Blondy (0)
   - 58 Team Aaron (4)
   - 64 Trollotopia (2)

 * Eclipse has "Y" picked for the national champion (should be one of A, C, M,
   or O).

 * There was no entry for Beach Bum's bonus Q #5 (Derrick Henry ...)

 * Opposite of Dad chose "TO" for Va. Tech vs Tulsa.  I'm assuming this is
   supposed to be Tulsa.

 * Opposite of Dad chose "TO" for LSU vs Texas Tech.  I'm assuming this should
   be Texas Tech.
